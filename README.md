# Computer Vision Projects
Four projects of computer vision are included.

## Dolly Room
Optical effect of dolly zoom. Simulate the effect that the view of object in the photo will be changed along with distance between the camera and object. Radial distortion is also added.

## Image Alignment
- Implement demosaic algorithm.
- Alignment images in different color channel. Take digitized Prokudin-Gorskii glass plate images and automatically produce	color	image.
- Implement multiscale alignment using faster search procedure, image pyramid.

## Depth Estimation
Use plane sweep algorithm to test groups of plane hypothese and find the best plane based on the dissimilarity measure. Check it [here](https://youtu.be/_QdDmH6OMc4)

## Segmentation
Utilize Support Vector Machine to segment the object inside a photo. Use morphological process to smooth the segmented images.
